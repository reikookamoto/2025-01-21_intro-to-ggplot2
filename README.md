# 2025-01-21_intro-to-ggplot2

Workshop with Bruyere Health Research Institute [LEARN\@WORK](mailto:LEARN@WORK){.email}

## Overview

In this workshop, we will explore the fundamentals of data visualization by learning how to create essential types of plots, including bar plots, line plots, and scatter plots.

Through hands-on exercises, you'll gain practical experience in using ggplot2 to effectively communicate your findings and enhance your data analysis skills.

## Intended Audience

This workshop is designed for:

-   Beginner programmers who are new to R;

-   Individuals experienced in other programming languages who want to learn R; and

-   Base R users interested in transitioning to the tidyverse.

Ideally, participants should have a basic understanding of programming concepts such as variables, data structures, and functions.

## Getting Started with the Repository

-   Clone or download the repository

    -   Clone the repository to your local machine using Git

    -   Alternatively, you can click the green "\<\> Code" button and select "Download ZIP" to download the repository as a ZIP file. After downloading, extract the contents.

-   After cloning or downloading, navigate to the project folder on your computer.

-   Double click on `2025-01-21_intro-to-ggplot2.Rproj` in the project root to open the RStudio Project.

-   Before running the code, make sure you have the following R packages installed:

    -   tidyverse

    -   here

    -   RColorBrewer

## Directory Structure

-   If you want to **code along**, open up `intro-to-ggplot2_code-along.qmd`, which provides skeletons for you to fill in as we work through the material.

-   If you prefer to **follow along without coding**, open `intro-to-ggplot2.qmd`, which already contains all the code.

-   `more-ggplot2.md` contains additional sample code for creating various plot types using ggplot2. We probably won't have time to cover this during the workshop.
